-----------

This has the java/swing jjmpeg library components.

Please see jjmpeg-core/README for further information about
jjmpeg in general.

STATUS
------

This builds the native code for all supported platforms using
cross compilation on GNU/linux operating systems only.

Currently supported targets are:

gnu-amd64 - 64 bit GNU/linux using system ffmpeg
gnu-i386 - 32 bit GNU/linux using system ffmpeg
mswin-amd64 - 64 bit mingwin32 using bundled ffmpeg

SWING COMPONENTS
----------------

JJMediaReader includes functionality for easily creating
BufferedImages from video frames.

JJFileChooser is a JFileChooser extended to show a live
preview of any video plus some simple meta-data.

SwingMediaPlayer is a very rough video-only video player
using the multi-threaded frame-work in jjmpeg-core.
