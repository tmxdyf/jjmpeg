BUILDING
--------

$ make

Will compile all target platforms.

config.mk defines the targets to be built.

build-ffmpeg compiles ffmpeg for the cross-compiled targets (mingwin32).

Perl must be installed, naturally.

TARGETS
-------

Each target has it's own directory which must define 3 files:

 Makefile - defines various options and includes jjmpeg.mk.

 jjmpeg-platform.h - platform specific includes and definitions.

 jjmpeg-platform.c - platform specific init and functions.  This must
 at least define:

   int platform_init(JNIEnv *env);

 Which returns <0 on error.

ISSUES
------

There are still some dependency problems, so for example one may have
to manually remove ffmpeg.built or jjmpeg.built to update the build.
