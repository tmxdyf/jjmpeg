----------

jjmpeg is a simple wrapper for ffmpeg.  It is a mostly hand-rolled
implementation with some native code generated by a simple c
programme to save some of the work.

STATUS
------

This is still work in progress and has very limited functionality
for reading video files.  This is all I need it for.

Only 64 bit binding is implemented, although supporting 32 bits
shouldn't be much work.

What API is there closely follows libavformat and libavcodec.

USING
-----

The library native/libjjmpeg.so must be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
the included version is only for 64 bit platforms and needs
to be compiled for others, or different versions of ffmpeg.

BUILDING
--------

A simple makefile is present in the native directly which builds the
library and generates the binding classes.  It's crap, but it
WORKSFORME.

The netbeans-supplied ant build file can be used to build the rest.
