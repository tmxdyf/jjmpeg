README 1st
----------

jjmpeg is a simple wrapper for ffmpeg.  It contains some hand-rolled
code with the rest autogenerated from OBAWO* perl script.

STATUS
------

This is still work in progress and has very limited functionality
for reading and writing video files.  This is all I need it for.

What API is there closely follows libavformat and libavcodec.

USING
-----

The library libjjmpeg.so must be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, use
the one from native/i686 for 32 bit platforms, or native/x86_64
for 32 bit platforms.

It will dlopen libavformat, libavcodec, and libswscale at run-time, so
these must be available on the system - usually in a package such as
ffmpeg-libs.

To test, try running:
 java -classpath dist/jjmpeg.jar jjmpeg.VideoWriterExample

This should create a 1 second video in /tmp/test.mpeg of a flying
'jjmpeg!'.

BUILDING
--------

Run ant in the top-level directory (where this README resides) to
compile the java classes.

If the supplied native library does not work with your installed
ffmpeg-libs, then run make in the native/ directory.  You may
need to edit the Makefile to point to the correct location of
your JDK.

For extending the binding, see native/README.  Currently the generated
Java file AVAbstract.java must be copied by hand to the src directory
to overwrite the one currently there.
