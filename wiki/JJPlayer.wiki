= JJPlayer =

JJPlayer is the player included in the android package.  Here are a few short notes about it.

 * It only uses software decoding provided by FFmpeg for all streams.
 * GLESv2 is used for the YUV to RGB conversion.
 * The activity is set up to be invoked for mime types video/`*` and audio/`*`
 * The activity is set up to be invoked for http or local resources of these mime types.
 * All networking code is using the FFmpeg i/o routines.
 * It will utilise multiple-core cpus.
 * There is and never will be any advertising, spying, or data collection of any kind.

The Internet Connectivity requirement is needed for HTTP streams.

= Known bugs =

This is seriously alpha software, so far from complete.

 * In the emulator the frames are displayed in the wrong order (rapid jumping), not sure if this happens on other hardware (probably so)
 * It usually crashes at the end of playing videos (it's just closing some resources in the wrong order).
 * For audio-only streams the progress bar doesn't update.
 * Audio-only streams do not play as a service (not in the background).
 * For some videos the progress bar doesn't progress cleanly but jumps back and forth.
 * The video is simply scaled to the screen size - no aspect ratio calculations are performed.

= License =

The license is and always will be GPLv3 or later.  The *full and complete source code* to the player is available on this site.
