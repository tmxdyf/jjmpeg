--------------

This includes the android-specific classes and the android
native target build.

Please see jjmpeg-core/README for further information about
jjmpeg in general.

STATUS
------

This includes an activity "JJPlayer" which implements a basic
interactive video and audio player.

Currently on an arm7-v7l build is created - this is basically ARM +
NEON.  GLES2 is also a requirement.

There is a very serious bug with the video player: at least on an ASUS
Transformer Prime this causes the video player to crash reliably.

BUILDING
--------

The build is mostly using the android sdk build scripts and standard
makefiles.  Within the jni directory there is another Makefile which
calls the android one (I don't care if this is not recommended
practice).

Run
 ./configure --target=X
To configure for a specific target.

Other configuration options are taken from ../jjmpeg-core/config.mk or
the various android configuration files.

make or ant then compiles the normal android targets.
